This project is an attempt to implement the idea proposed by the person from the channel "
Josh's Channel" I didn't find, and in truth, I didn't really look for the implementation of the algorithm outlined in one of the videos. 
The algorithm seemed interesting and rather unusual. There will be a lot of errors and strange solutions, the choice of the C language 
was already a strange solution, but if someone stumbles upon this repository, I will be glad to hear your suggestions for improving the code.
